The EZ Omega font was created by Father Ephraim of St. Anthony's Monastery in Arizona. It has not been modified. The original font is part of the "EZ" Byzantine music fonts package available at: http://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/music/ByzMusicFonts.html

The BZ Byzantina series fonts were developed by Stefanos Souldatos and Father Ephraim. Permission has been granted to Clement Erik Ferguson to convert the encoding of the fonts to Unicode, for the purpose of compatibility with the Pango font rendering library, and to redistribute them. The original fonts are avilable at http://www.dblab.ntua.gr/~stef/mysite/php/index.php?pg=pgbyz&lang=en

The sfd files are included for use with Font Forge; however, permission should be requested from the respective creator(s) of the fonts before redistributing modified versions.
