# byzscribe: A program for scribing Byzantine chant

![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/muraiki/byzscribe/blob/master/byzchant2.png)

Byzscribe is a program for scribing Byzantine chant, written in the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) language. The intent of this project is to produce a program that can receive purely textual input (as a free and open format) and generate a graphical file with the appropriate neumes. This project is not intended to create a GUI for editing byzantine chant -- that will come after Byzscribe has been developed more, and will tie into this project.

## The state of chant notation

There currently exists no free and open format for byzantine chant notation. Because of this, there are a number of byzantine chant programs that are incompatible with each other. This situation has led, at least in the English-speaking world of byzantine chant, to the use of Word and PDF files for exchanging notation. This is not ideal, as it is difficult to parse such files for use in other programs.

For instance, it would be a great boon to develop a program that aids in composing chant using established formulae, but the formulae are only available as a PDF. It would also be nice to develop software tutors to aid in learning chant, but they cannot use the existing corpus of transcribed chant.

While it is great to have such resources available at all, ideally they would use a free and open, machine readable standard for notation in order to not only greater facilitate the exchange of chant itself but also to allow easier development of a software ecosystem for byzantine chant.

## What I'm working on

I want to get some info into the project wiki, especially in regards to a project roadmap. I will also update the issues section with the features that I'm looking to implement. But most importantly, I'm currently researching licenses to find out what license would work best for this project and any other projects built on top of it. One of the driving forces behind this project is my belief that it is important to develop an open ecosystem of byzantine chant applications. In so doing, I humbly hope to open the beauty of Orthodox Christian hymnography and byzantine chant to ever more people.
