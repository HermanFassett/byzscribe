byzscribe

A program for scribing Byzantine chant, written in Racket.

I'm new to Git and programming, so this is going to take me a bit to get up and running! Let me know if you are interested in helping out.

I'm not yet interested in making a GUI for this program; that will probably be a separate project. My focus is on creating a DSL for Byzantine chant.
